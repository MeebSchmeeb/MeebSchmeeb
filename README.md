Welcome to my ReadMe, I'm MeebSchmeeb, but you can also call me Meeb/Meebo. My pronouns are they/he and I prefer neutral terms.

I'm currently interested in game development with Ren'Py so that's what I'm trying to learn at the moment. Progress is slow and if my activity goes blank for a while, I probably bounced to a new idea for some other creative hobby.
